# Tools of the Mind Reporter
This project was designed to give the users of the Tools of the Mind program a way to take data that is entered into LinkIt!'s data locker and use Google Sheets to generate a 2 page report for each student.

It is recommended that this project be installed on a G Suite for Education domain. The Code.gs file is bound to a spreadsheet and must be published as an Add-on.

Make a copy of [this file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uf8wSzkYpPbh-Cx0ouFeJDPsKMb_5IJoMPVzH35fn4A/copy) 

You will need to adjust the code in the Code.gs file so that it points to your new template spreadsheet ID (on line 120). The ID can be found in the [address bar of your new copy](https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/9/91/Google_Spreadsheet_Key_from_url.png).

Lastly, you will need to build out your Data Locker to match.
Instructions forthcoming.
